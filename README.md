## Features

- **Persistent Connections**: Maintain open connections with IoT devices for real-time communication.
- **Secure Authentication**: Ensure only authorized devices can connect and communicate.
- **Low Resource Usage**: Optimized for low CPU and memory usage, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments.
- **Custom Event Loop**: Handles multiple connections asynchronously, without relying on external libraries.
